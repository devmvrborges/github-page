In personal projects, I choose languages different from those of work to broaden my experience. I have already worked as a facilitator of requirements and deliveries when allocated to customers and suppliers. I highlight the creation of an ORM in NodeJS for a database without documentation, covering millions of records to guarantee the quality of the project. I also developed software in C# for communicating with PLCs, Yaskawa robots and computer vision cameras, focusing on employee ergonomics in a Taiwanese company, among other challenges overcome."
